# This workflow runs changesets action to update version
# strings/changelogs throught the repo and open a pull request with
# latest version.
#
# Merging the PR does not cause automatic releases (yet). After you
# merge the PR, you must create tags for all updated packages to
# trigger release workflows.
#
# If you don't plan to release all changed packages simultaneously,
# you may temporarily disable some packages by adding them to
# .changeset/config.json's `ignore` field.
